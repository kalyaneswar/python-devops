Python Scripting
----------------
1. Variables -> data types
2. Conditions
3. Loops
4. Functions
5. Use cases

- Python, Java, C, C++, C#, Golang etc

- Static Typed languages: You have to define the data type variable before executing the program
	- int a = 42;
	- float b = 45.35;
- Dynamic Typed languages: The compiler is intelligent enough to understand the datatype of the variable
	- a = 42
	- b = True
	- c = "DevOps"
- Immediate proto type (POC): Python
- Syntax is very easy to learn

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
	print(fruit)
	
- Python is widely used for automation, Deep Learning applications, Natural Language processing (ChatGPT, Gemini, Github Copiolot)
- Web Development (Django)

- Installation of python: AWS (Cloudshell)

Commenting
----------
- Single line comment: # This is a single line comment
- Multi Line comment

Variables
---------
- It is container to store some values inside
- a = 42
- Python scripts are saved using .py

- Integer
- Boolean
- Strings
- Float

- List
- Tuple
- Set
- Dictionary

- Python is case-sensitive i.e. devops and DevOps are 2 different things

- Naming convention:
- snake_case
- snake-case (This is incorrect)
- camelCase
- CONSTANTS

- by default division returns a float value
